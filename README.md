AstroCore is an Ada and SPARK-based real-time embedded framework specifically designed for CubeSat and small satellite missions. It provides a robust, reliable, and efficient foundation for developing high-assurance software systems in space applications.

## Purpose

The AstroCore framework aims to simplify the development process for CubeSat missions by providing a modular, easy-to-use, and safety-critical environment. With AstroCore, developers can focus on building their mission-specific application logic without worrying about low-level hardware management and real-time constraints.

## Key Features

- **Ada and SPARK integration**: AstroCore leverages the power and safety features of Ada and SPARK programming languages, ensuring high-reliability and formal verifiability for mission-critical systems.

- **Real-time capabilities**: AstroCore is designed with real-time performance in mind, supporting concurrent task execution, deterministic scheduling, and resource management.

- **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**: The framework includes a comprehensive HAL that abstracts the hardware specifics of the SAMV71Q21B microcontroller, enabling portable and reusable code across different platforms.

- **Modular architecture**: AstroCore promotes a modular design, allowing developers to build, integrate, and test different components of their system independently.

- **Support for common peripherals**: AstroCore provides built-in support for I2C, SPI, UART, and CANBus communication protocols, making it easy to interface with various sensors, actuators, and communication modules.

- **Middleware integration**: The framework is compatible with middleware libraries, such as littlefs, libcsp, and others, allowing seamless integration of advanced features and satellite protocols.

- **Documentation and resources**: AstroCore comes with extensive documentation, examples, and resources to help developers get started quickly and efficiently.
